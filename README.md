With sets, your lists will still show, but if there are words that are duplicates one of them will be deleted. This is came as interesting to me and honestly, was fun to mess around with. 

Reading words into a keyboard until "stop" has been entered.(Include some duplicate words when you enter them.) Then, display the number of unique words that were entered, followed by a list of words.
